# Blog with Django

A blog built with Django and Python. If you are interested in seeing some cool features of my blog, here is a [link](https://arsh-django-blog.vercel.app/) to my blog.

## Why the project is useful?

I have built this project using Python, Django, SQLite for local server deployment, and Postgresql for the remote server. The styling of the website is solely done with CSS.
I have maintained the simplicity and legibility of the program. 

+ The HTML codes for the structure of the website are inside the [blog/templates/blog](https://github.com/ArshdeepKaurArora/Arsh_Django_Blog/tree/main/blog/templates/blog) file.
+ The CSS codes and images for the designs of the website are inside the [staticfiles](https://github.com/ArshdeepKaurArora/Arsh_Django_Blog/tree/main/staticfiles) file.
+ The Python code for the API calls and the conditions are inside the [blog/views.py](https://github.com/ArshdeepKaurArora/Arsh_Django_Blog/blob/main/blog/views.py) file.

## Some cool features on the website

The blog is built in a way to store cache data for the user's read-later list. In a way, it is a dynamic website.
Some of the cool features of the website which make it user-friendly are:

+ A user can add a comment below the post that he/she might interested in.
+ A user can add a post to their read-later list and remove the reading is done.
+ A user can contact me via email using the [contact](https://arsh-django-blog.vercel.app/contact) page on the blog.
+ A user can visit my GitHub profile and know about my work in some more detail on my [about](https://arsh-django-blog.vercel.app/about) webpage.
